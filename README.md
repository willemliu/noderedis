This is an example project showing how to setup a project using NodeJS, Express, Redis, Redis Cluster, TypeScript and Gulp.

Caching is a very important aspect of webdevelopment and nearly all high-traffic server applications use caching to be able to reliably serve their content.
This example project is created as part of my research on how to use a clustered Redis in combination with a NodeJS/Express server application. I've also taken the liberty to use TypeScript as my supporting dialect because I like the syntax of exporting/importing modules better than the "Node"-way. And I believe it makes developing monolith applications easier with better IDE support.
